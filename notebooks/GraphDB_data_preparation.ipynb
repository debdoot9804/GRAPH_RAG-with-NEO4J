    "- `Person`: Represents an individual who can either be an <u>actor</u> or a <u>director</u> (or both) in movies. Each person node has a <u>single attribute</u>, **name**, which is the name of the person.\n",
    "- `Genre`: Represents a movie genre. Each genre node has a <u>single attribute</u>, **name**, which is the genre type (e.g., Action, Comedy, Drama, etc.).\n",
    "- `Location`: Represents the location where the movies was taken. Each location has a single attribute **name**, which is the name of the location (e.g: United States, United Kingdom)\n",
    "- `SimilarMovie`: Rrpresents a similar movie to its corresponding movie. Each similar movie has a single attribute **name**, which is the name of the movie (e.g: Finding Nemo. Which is the similar movie for Toy story)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relationships:**\n",
    "- `:DIRECTED`: A directional relationship from a Person node to a Movie node, signifying that the person directed the movie.\n",

    "- `:IN_GENRE`: A directional relationship from a Movie node to a Genre node, signifying that the movie belongs to that particular genre.\n",
    "- `:WAS_TAKEN_IN`: A directional relationship from a Movie node to a Location node, signifying that the movie was taken in that location.\n",
    "- `:IS_SIMILAR_TO`: A directional relationship from a Movie node to a SimilarMovie node, signifying that movies is similar to the one we are looking at.\n",

    "**Instructions in the script:**\n",
    "- `LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS`: Loads a CSV file that contains the movie data with headers indicating each column's purpose.\n",
    "- `MERGE`: Ensures that a node or relationship is created if it does not already exist; otherwise, it matches the existing node or relationship. This prevents duplication.\n",
    "- `SET`: Assigns properties to the nodes after they've been created or matched.\n",
    "- `FOREACH`: Executes the contained commands for each element in a list. This is used to iterate over the lists of directors, actors, and genres associated with each movie. It ensures that all the respective Person and Genre nodes are created and linked appropriately to the Movie nodes."
